Output

Two words are considered anagrams if by rearranging the letters of the first word we get the second word. For instance cinema and iceman are anagrams.
 
 
Given a list of word pairs, your task is to:
- write a function that determines for each pair if it's an anagram or not
- for each pair of words your function will print to standard output (stdout) the value 1 if the pair is an anagram or 0 otherwise
 
Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
- firstWords: an array of strings giving the first word for each of the pairs
- secondWords: an array of strings giving the corresponding second word
 
Data constraints
- all words will contain only lowercase English letters (a-z)
 
Example
Input
firstWords: "cinema", "host", "aba", "train"
secondWords: "iceman", "shot", "bab", "rain"
 
Output
1 1 0 0
